I'm extremely passionate about the world of programming, and since a very young age curious about how things really work in computing. I love learning new technologies and facing challenges, because for me, being stagnant is a nightmare. Lately I've been giving a lot of focus to the most current technologies for Web Development.

#### Focusing on: Next.js, Laravel and Docker
